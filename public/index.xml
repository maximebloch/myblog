      <description>The start The plan Execution 17&amp;frasl;12 After lunch i tried to get the crack arm of with new gathered energy. I quickly noticed that poping it off using a hammer and long piece of steel was not going to work. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t moving at all and because off the lack of a bike stand or other tools to keep the frame fixed I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the proper force onto the cranckarm needed to push it off.</description>
