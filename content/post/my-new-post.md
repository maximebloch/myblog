# The start

# The plan

# Execution


### 17/12

After lunch i tried to get the crack arm of with new gathered energy. I quickly noticed that poping it off using a hammer and long piece of steel was not going to work. It wasn't moving at all and because off the lack of a bike stand or other tools to keep the frame fixed I couldn't get the proper force onto the cranckarm needed to push it off. The edges already showed that it was somewhat rusted which wasn't helping. Looking for other solutions online I found someone using a gear puller (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQRENlsXwTQ), which looks like a promising solution in which I don't bend any other parts of my bike.
