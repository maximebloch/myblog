This is me, i'm an informatics student at the Univesity of Ghent.

I have a certain need to structure what I do and I can't find the thing that works for me. This is an attempt to try to write some stuff I do down in a blog. It doens't have a goal of entertaining, it is mostly for myself but everyone else who can get anything usefull out of it, good luck! :)

My idea is to make it a point of information i put online so i don't have to store it somewhere private where i can only acces it in limited times.
